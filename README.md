# BareConductive Python SDK

A python sdk that allows reading from a Bare Conductive board executing the DataStream application.

You have two files:

bareconductive.py: the sdk itself

bcserver.py: a websocket server able to serve bareconductive readings in json format

This is a rough implementation developed during the Music Hack Day Barcelona 2015. There is a looooot to improve. Also my first Python code, so any suggestion is welcome :)
